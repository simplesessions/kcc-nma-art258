#### KCC NMA ART-258
# Week 08

## Class/Homework Exercise - Code Mobile and Desktop Wireframes

Download the [week 8 files](https://simplesessions.com/kcc/week8.zip) and, using the Home and Mobile Home PDFs found inside the zip file as reference files to help code a single web page with Media Queries that adjusts to the browser viewport. Using the [class starter files](https://github.com/simplesessions/kcc-nma-art258-starter), you'll create a single page that looks on par with the wireframes provided.

Make it look as much like the wireframe as much as possible, down to the primary color used, which can be sampled from the PDF. Sampling the color will be left as an exercise for you, and if someone feels like sharing the hex code for it, please do so. There is some wiggle room for fonts and the gray colors used. For instance, Avenir is used in the PDFs as the primary typeface. Since we're not rich and can't all just buy _Avenir_, make use of something that comes close from Google Fonts as a substitute.

You'll find images that you can use in the assets folder.

### Requirements

- Single page that makes use of media queries to match the wireframes as much as possible
- Utilize Google Fonts to find a font similar to the one in the wireframes
- Make use of Sass variables for any color, or dimension used within your code

### Turning This In

- This is due next Tuesday, October 18th. Just zip the _src_ folder up and sent it to my email. Remember, JUST the _src_ folder.
