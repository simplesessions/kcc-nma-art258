## Class Notes

### Sites Shared

- [sirinlabs.com](sirinlabs.com)
  - Loading takes a while, but payoff is worth it. Keep in mind other ways to keep your users on your site while they wait for experience.
  - Cool 3D sphere thing done using `<canvas>`, WebGL, and the Web Audio API.
  - Very cool demo – we won't be doing that in this class :)
- [pharrellwilliams.com](pharrellwilliams.com)
	- Cool way to keep first-time visitors busy while site loads in the background. Usually splash screens are a no-no, but this one does it tastefully.
	- Large site that's made up various animations and music playing in the back.
	- Site is driven mostly by a large `<canvas>` that pays attention to mouse movement.

### Class Exercises

- [Codepen: Laying Out Containers](http://codepen.io/simplesessions/pen/amoYNV)

#### Suggested Exercises

- [Fork the Codepen example](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/forks/) above an experiment with different ways to change up the layout:
	- What happens when you add more than one article?
	- Try changing the size of the outer `main` container. What happens to the articles below?
	- Try adding more content to each of the containers.
	- Try messing around with more values for `justify-content` values.
